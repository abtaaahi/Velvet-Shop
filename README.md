## Code Explanation
### 1. Dynamic Product Slider
The product slider dynamically updates the product displayed based on user interaction with the navigation items (hoodies, sneakers, etc.).
```
menuItems.forEach((item, index) => {
  item.addEventListener("click", () => {
    wrapper.style.transform = `translateX(${-100 * index}vw)`;
    choosenProduct = products[index];
    currentProductTitle.textContent = choosenProduct.title;
    currentProductPrice.textContent = choosenProduct.price + "à§³";
    currentProductImg.src = choosenProduct.colors[0].img;
    currentProductColors.forEach((color, index) => {
      color.style.backgroundColor = choosenProduct.colors[index].code;
    });
  });
});
```
- Functionality: This snippet adds a click event listener to each navigation item (e.g., Hoodie, Sneakers). When an item is clicked, the slider translates to display the corresponding product.
- Dynamic Update: It updates the product title, price, image, and color options based on the selected product.
### 2. Changing Product Colors
Users can switch between different color options for a selected product.
```
currentProductColors.forEach((color, index) => {
  color.addEventListener("click", () => {
    currentProductImg.src = choosenProduct.colors[index].img;
  });
});
```
- Functionality: This part of the code listens for a click on the color options and changes the product image based on the selected color.
### 3. Selecting Product Sizes
When users click on a product size, it is highlighted to show the selection.
```
currentProductSizes.forEach((size, index) => {
  size.addEventListener("click", () => {
    currentProductSizes.forEach((size) => {
      size.style.backgroundColor = "white";
      size.style.color = "black";
    });
    size.style.backgroundColor = "black";
    size.style.color = "white";
  });
});
```
- Functionality: This code highlights the selected size by changing its background color to black and the text color to white. Other sizes revert to their default colors.
### 4. Payment Modal
When the user clicks the "Buy Now" button, the payment section is displayed.
```
productButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  payment.style.display = "flex";
});
```
- Functionality: This code opens the payment modal when the user clicks the "Buy Now" button, allowing them to enter their personal and payment information.
### 5. Closing the Payment Modal
The payment modal can be closed by clicking the 'X' button.
```
close.addEventListener("click", () => {
  payment.style.display = "none";
});
```
- Functionality: This snippet hides the payment modal when the close button ('X') is clicked, allowing the user to return to the product page.
